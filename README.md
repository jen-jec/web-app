# Book Review App

## Description
This is a web application that allows users to manage books and their reviews. It supports adding, editing, and deleting their read books with their details.

## Disclaimer
This web app is made by a rookie, thus lacks proper functionality and practice. The rookie did this for a project and also to help them keep track of their ability and skills and to see and improve areas they lack. Will be expecting a better version of this app soon and more... :>
